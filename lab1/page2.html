            <p>Nature is in crisis. Climate change is driving record-breaking heatwaves, raging wildfires and devastating floods, leaving destruction in its wake. Meanwhile, forests are torn down, oceans are polluted and precious ecosystems are pushed to the brink, as faceless corporations rip through biodiverse habitats and communities for profit.

            For the world’s most vulnerable, these events mean losing homes, livelihoods and even lives. This crisis isn’t just an environmental issue – it’s a human one. And with every passing day, as governments clamp down on the rights of those raising the alarm and aim to silence us, the window for action narrows.

            We can’t afford to wait. Together, we must stand up for people and planet here and around the world.</p>
